# ðŸ”„ Single Number

## ðŸ“œ Problem Statement

Given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, where every element appears twice except for one, find that single one.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Write a function to determine the single number that appears only once in the array.

## ðŸŒŸ Example

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```cpp
nums = [2, 2, 1]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
1
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```cpp
nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
4
```

### Example 3:

**Input:**

```cpp
nums = [1]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
1
```

## ðŸš€ Approach: Bit Manipulation

### *Algorithm*

1. Initialize a variable `ans` to `0`.
2. Iterate through each element in the array:
   - Use the XOR operation (`^`) to combine the current element with `ans`.
3. The XOR operation has the property that `x ^ x = 0` and `x ^ 0 = x`. Therefore, all duplicate elements will cancel each other out, leaving only the single number.
4. Return `ans` as the result.

### *Time Complexity*:
- The algorithm runs in *O(n)* time, where `n` is the length of the array.

### *Space Complexity*:
- The algorithm uses *O(1)* extra space.

### ðŸ’» Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i : nums) {
            ans ^= i;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4`
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Key Points

- The solution uses bit manipulation with the XOR operation to efficiently find the single number.
- It ensures linear runtime complexity and constant extra space usage.
- The implementation is concise and leverages the properties of the XOR operation.
