# ðŸ”„ Maximum Subarray

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Write a function to determine the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within a given array of integers.

## âœ¨ Example

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```cpp
nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
6
```

**Explanation:** The subarray `[4, -1, 2, 1]` has the largest sum of `6`.

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```cpp
nums = [1]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
1
```

**Explanation:** The subarray `[1]` has the largest sum of `1`.

### Example 3:

**Input:**

```cpp
nums = [5, 4, -1, 7, 8]
```

**Output:**

```cpp
23
```

**Explanation:** The subarray `[5, 4, -1, 7, 8]` has the largest sum of `23`.

## ðŸš€ Approach: Kadane's Algorithm

### *Algorithm*

1. Initialize two variables: `currsum` to keep track of the current subarray sum and `maxsum` to store the maximum sum found.
2. Iterate through each element in the array:
   - Add the current element to `currsum`.
   - Update `maxsum` if `currsum` is greater than `maxsum`.
   - If `currsum` becomes negative, reset it to `0`.
3. Return `maxsum` as the result.

### *Time Complexity*:
- The algorithm runs in *O(n)* time, where `n` is the length of the array.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int currsum = 0, maxsum = INT_MIN;
        for (int i : nums) {
            currsum += i;
            maxsum = max(currsum, maxsum);
            if (currsum < 0) {
                currsum = 0;
            }
        }
        return maxsum;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

---

## ðŸŒŸ Key Points

- The solution uses Kadane's Algorithm, which efficiently finds the maximum sum subarray in linear time.
- It handles both positive and negative integers in the array.
- The implementation is straightforward and easy to understand.
- A follow-up challenge involves implementing a divide-and-conquer approach for the same problem.
